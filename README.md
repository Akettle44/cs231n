# CS231n

## Background
This repository contains my homework from Stanford's 2017 offering of cs231n that can be found at: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/ 
Skeleton code and helper functions were written by the Stanford instructors and TAs. Code written by me can be found in between comments that looks like: <br/>
